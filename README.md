Agro Chain Using BlockChain
In AgroChain Farmers will provide name of the Crops and their expected yield from the field and these details are distributed in a public ledger(BlockChain).
So entities in the Network (here Consumers) can view the details of crops and expected yield from  each farmers and they can also access the previous cultivations of farmers. 
This creates a transparent and tamper -proof digital market platform for farm product.
So here a smart contract (agreement) is formed between  farmer and Consumer, consumer can fund for crops at the initial process and can acquire yield directly from the farm. 
These helps the farmers not to wait for the bank loan or any other lending  mechanisms at  the initial period of  investment
The consumers could provide the fund with zero interest also that consumers can  rate the quality of crops which builds a credibility of farmer and consumer based on their previous experiences .
